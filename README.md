This was an one week group project by  [rolandosorbelli](https://github.com/rolandosorbelli), [pyan83](https://www.github.com/pyan83),
[Samellenrider](https://github.com/Samellenrider) and
[Denisglb](https://github.com/Denisglb). We chose to take up the challenge of learning Swift 4 from scratch without any prior knowledge of it at all.

## Tech Stack
- XCode 9
- Swift 4
- XCTest

## Features
- A player can move the Pokeball by tilting the phone.
- A player can collect Pikachus by moving the Pokeball to touch them.
- A score accumulates as the Pikachus get collected.
- The game ends when the Pokeball touches TeamRocket enemies.
- The game can be reset by tapping the screen once it has ended.
